# The argument principle for a cycle running through the zeros

The argument principle in the form that tolerates zeros and poles **on** the contour. For `f`
whose zeros and poles in an open `U` all lie in a finite `S ⊆ U`, and a closed piecewise-`C¹`
*immersion* `γ` null-homologous in `U` and based off `S`, the Cauchy principal value of the
logarithmic integral is

`p.v. ∮_γ f'/f = 2πi · Σ_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord_z f`,

with the generalized (non-integer) winding numbers as weights. Where
`TauCeti.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous` requires `γ` to avoid `S` and produces an
ordinary integral, here `γ` may run through the points of `S` — a zero on the contour is a pole
of `f'/f` on the contour, so the integral exists only as a principal value, and the point
contributes its order weighted by a winding number that need not be an integer. In the standard
configuration — a positively oriented curve with a single smooth branch through the point — that
weight is `1/2`; in general the generalized winding number at such a point is the average of the
two ordinary winding numbers on either side of the branch, so any `k ± 1/2` occurs.

The proof is the Hungerbühler–Wasem residue theorem in its simple-pole regime
(`TauCeti.Contour.hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem_of_simple_poles`) applied to `logDeriv f`,
whose residue at each point is the order of `f` there
(`TauCeti.Contour.residue_logDeriv_eq_meromorphicOrderAt`). What that regime asks for is that
`logDeriv f` have at worst a simple pole at each point of `S`, which is
`TauCeti.Contour.neg_one_le_meromorphicOrderAt_logDeriv`: HW's conditions (A′) and (B) are then
automatic, so no regularity hypothesis beyond the immersion survives into the statement. That
bound is not an extra assumption on `f` but a fact about logarithmic derivatives — `f'/f` has a
simple pole at a zero or pole of `f` whatever the order there — which is why the hypotheses below
are those of the classical statement with the avoidance dropped.

Immersion, rather than mere piecewise-`C¹` regularity, is what the principal value at an on-curve
singularity needs: the curve must leave the point at a definite speed for the excised integrals to
converge.

/-- **The argument principle for a cycle running through the zeros.** For `f` analytic and
non-vanishing on `U` off a finite `S ⊆ U`, meromorphic at each point of `S` of order `ord`, and a
closed piecewise-`C¹` immersion `γ` in `U`, null-homologous there and based off `S`,

`p.v. ∮_γ f'/f = 2πi · Σ_{z ∈ S} n_z(γ) · ord z`.

Unlike `TauCeti.Contour.argumentPrinciple_nullHomologous`, the curve is free to pass through the
points of `S`: where the order is nonzero `f'/f` then has a pole on the contour, the integral
exists only as a principal value, and the generalized winding number supplies the weight, which
need not be an integer — `1/2` in the standard configuration of a positively oriented curve with
a single smooth branch through the point. Only the basepoint `γ a` is required to avoid `S`, as
it is what the principal value is anchored at.

The order function is prescribed at every point of `S`; `S` may list regular non-vanishing points
of `f`, whose order is `0` and which therefore contribute nothing. -/
