# The half-disc boundary contour

For `0 < R`, the boundary of the upper half-disc of radius `R` about the origin, traversed
counterclockwise on `[-R, R + π]`: the diameter along the real axis from `-R` to `R`, followed by
the semicircular arc from `R` back to `-R`, the arc carrying its angle in `t - R`.

Its distinguishing feature is that it passes **through** the origin rather than detouring around
it, so the origin is an on-curve point and the generalized winding number there is `½` — the value
strictly between the exterior `0` and the interior `1`:

* the diameter contributes `0`: the index integrand `1 / t` is odd, so its principal value over
  the symmetric interval vanishes (`windingNumber_eq_zero_segment`);
* the arc contributes `½`: it is a half-circle about its own centre, so its winding is its angular
  extent `π / 2π` (`windingNumber_circleMap_center_eq_half`).

That `½` is exactly the hypothesis of the Hungerbühler–Wasem half-residue theorem
`hasCauchyPV_half_residue`, which is why this contour is the one HW's motivating example uses: a
Cauchy principal value along the real axis with a simple pole at the origin, where the classical
residue theorem does not apply because the pole lies *on* the contour.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Contour.halfDiscBoundary` — the contour, with `halfDiscBoundary_of_le` and
  `halfDiscBoundary_of_lt` evaluating its two branches and `halfDiscBoundary_left`,
  `halfDiscBoundary_right` its endpoints (equal, so the contour is closed).
* `TauCeti.Contour.windingNumber_halfDiscBoundary` — its generalized winding number about the
  origin is `½`.
