# The universal normalised elliptic divisibility sequence

A normalised EDS over a commutative ring `R` is determined by three parameters `b, c, d : R`.
Taking those parameters to be three indeterminates gives the **universal** normalised EDS

`universalNormEDS : ℤ → MvPolynomial NormEDSParam ℤ`,

of which every normalised EDS is a specialization: `normEDS b c d` is `universalNormEDS` followed
by the evaluation sending the indeterminates to `b, c, d` (`normEDS_eq_aeval`), and likewise for
`preNormEDS` and for the two complement sequences (`preNormEDS_eq_aeval`, `complEDS₂_eq_aeval`,
`complEDS_eq_aeval`).

The point is that an identity between expressions in the terms of a normalised EDS need only be
proved once, over `MvPolynomial NormEDSParam ℤ`, and then specialises to every ring and every
choice of parameters. Working universally also buys an integral domain to work in, which the
parameters' ring need not be.

## Main definitions

* `NormEDSParam`: a three-element index type for the parameters `b`, `c`, `d` of a normalised EDS.
* `universalNormEDS`: the normalised EDS over `ℤ[B, C, D]` whose parameters are the three
  indeterminates.

## Main results

* `normEDS_eq_aeval`, `preNormEDS_eq_aeval`, `complEDS₂_eq_aeval`, `complEDS_eq_aeval`: every
  normalised EDS, and each of its associated sequences, is the universal one specialised along
  `NormEDSParam.rec b c d`.

## Implementation notes

The constructors of `NormEDSParam` are uppercase because they name indeterminates rather than
elements, matching `WeierstrassCurve.Coeff` in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Universal.lean`, which plays the same role for the
universal Weierstrass curve.

Only `normEDS` gets a named universal object. The three companion sequences are stated against
`preNormEDS (X B) (X C) (X D)` and its analogues written out, since naming each one would add three
definitions whose only use is to be unfolded — the sequences are already determined by the
parameters, and it is the specialization statement that consumers need, not a new name for its
left-hand side. Those three carry an explicit `X (R := ℤ)`: with the coefficient ring appearing
only under `aeval`, elaboration has nothing to pin it to and reports a stuck `CommSemiring`
instance otherwise.

## Provenance

Ported from J. Xu's `LutzNagell/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main` at
`1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`), declarations `NormEDSParam`, `universalNormEDS`,
`normEDS_eq_aeval`, `compl₂EDS_eq_aeval` and `complEDS_eq_aeval`. That file's header reads
`Authors: Junyan Xu`; following this repository's convention for adapted material the upstream
authorship is credited here rather than in the copyright header.

The same declarations sit in **Mathlib PR #13057** (open, last updated 2024-07-31), the
upstreaming of that AINTLIB file, so they are portable under this project's rule and deduplicate
when it lands. `compl₂EDS` is spelt `complEDS₂` here, following Mathlib's subsequent rename of the
elliptic-net API (`addMulSub → IsEllipticNet.atom`, `net → IsEllipticNet.rel`,
`rel₄ → IsEllipticNet.atomRel`, `IsEllSequence → IsEllipticSequence`, `compl₂EDS → complEDS₂`),
which #13057 predates.

`preNormEDS_eq_aeval` is new: the source states the principle for `normEDS` and the two
complements but not for `preNormEDS`, although Mathlib's `map_preNormEDS` makes it the same
one-line proof and consumers reaching for the pre-normalised sequence would otherwise have to
redo it.

Deliberately **not** ported here: `universalNormEDS_ne_zero` and
`universalNormEDS_mem_nonZeroDivisors`. They rest on `normEDS 2 3 2 = id`, whose proof needs
`normEDS` to be known an elliptic sequence — which the pinned Mathlib does not know, and which is
the content of the separate open Mathlib PR #42453. They belong with whichever slice ports that.
