# Counting the integral ideals of a ray class

Let `𝔪` be a modulus of a number field `K` and `c` a ray class of `𝔪`.  This file introduces
`rayClassIdealCountingFunction 𝔪 c x`, the number of nonzero integral ideals prime to the finite
part of `𝔪` that lie in the class `c` and have norm at most `x`, and proves the two facts that
make it a counting function at all: the sets being counted are finite, and summing over the ray
class group recovers the unrestricted count.

The carrier is `integralIdealsPrimeTo 𝔪`, the monoid on which `idealClass` is defined, so
coprimality and nonvanishing are forced by the type rather than imposed as side conditions; the
zero ideal and ideals sharing a prime with the finite part cannot enter the count.

Finiteness comes from Mathlib's `Ideal.finite_setOfPred_absNorm_le` after replacing the real bound
`x` by `⌊x⌋₊`, which loses nothing because the norm is a natural number.  The bound is taken in `ℝ`
rather than `ℕ` because the asymptotics that consume this count are.

The partition is stated first as an equivalence, `idealClassSigmaEquiv`, and only then in counting
form.  The equivalence needs no finiteness at all, and it is what a consumer weighting the classes
by a character reaches for; the counting statement is its `Nat.card` shadow.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.rayClassIdealCountingFunction`: the number of nonzero integral ideals
  prime to `𝔪` in a fixed ray class with norm at most `x`.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.idealClassSigmaEquiv`: the ideals prime to `𝔪` of norm at most `x`,
  partitioned into their ray classes.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.sum_rayClassIdealCountingFunction`: the class counts sum to the
  unrestricted count of nonzero integral ideals prime to `𝔪` of norm at most `x`.

/-! ### The counting function and the class partition -/

/-- **The ray class ideal counting function.**  The number of nonzero integral ideals in the ray
class `c` of `𝔪`, prime to the finite part of `𝔪`, whose norm is at most `x`.  The carrier already
forces coprimality and nonvanishing, so the zero ideal and other classes cannot enter. -/
noncomputable def rayClassIdealCountingFunction
    (𝔪 : Modulus K) (c : RayClassGroup 𝔪) (x : ℝ) : ℕ :=
  Nat.card {I : integralIdealsPrimeTo 𝔪 //
    idealClass 𝔪 I = c ∧ (Ideal.absNorm (I : Ideal (𝓞 K)) : ℝ) ≤ x}

/-- **The ray classes partition the ideals of bounded norm.**  An ideal prime to `𝔪` of norm at
most `x` is the same thing as a ray class together with an ideal of that class and that norm
bound, because `idealClass 𝔪` is a function on the carrier and the summands are exactly its
fibres. -/
noncomputable def idealClassSigmaEquiv (𝔪 : Modulus K) (x : ℝ) :
    (Σ c : RayClassGroup 𝔪, {I : integralIdealsPrimeTo 𝔪 //
        idealClass 𝔪 I = c ∧ (Ideal.absNorm (I : Ideal (𝓞 K)) : ℝ) ≤ x}) ≃

      (Equiv.subtypeEquivRight fun _ ↦ and_comm).trans

    (Equiv.sigmaFiberEquiv fun I : {I : integralIdealsPrimeTo 𝔪 //
      (Ideal.absNorm (I : Ideal (𝓞 K)) : ℝ) ≤ x} ↦ idealClass 𝔪 I.1)

/-- **The class counts sum to the total.**  Summing `rayClassIdealCountingFunction` over the ray
class group recovers the number of nonzero integral ideals prime to `𝔪` of norm at most `x`.

The ray class group is always finite (`finite_rayClassGroup`), but it carries no canonical
`Fintype`, so the enumeration is taken as a hypothesis rather than fixed to `Fintype.ofFinite`
here; that keeps the statement usable against whichever enumeration the caller holds. -/
