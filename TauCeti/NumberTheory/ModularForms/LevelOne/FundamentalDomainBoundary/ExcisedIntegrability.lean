# The excised boundary integrand is integrable

`intervalIntegral_excised_logDeriv_fdBoundary` assembles the excised boundary integral from
integrability *assumed* on `[0, 1]`, `[1, 2]` and `[4, 5]`. This file discharges that assumption,
for any subinterval of `[0, 5]` at once.

Both inputs the general criterion needs are available for the boundary contour: its derivative is
globally bounded (`exists_norm_deriv_fdBoundary_le`), and off the excision the contour stays in
the open set where the form is analytic and nonvanishing, so its logarithmic derivative is
analytic there (`analyticAt_logDeriv_of_analyticAt`) and in particular continuous.

This shares `hH`, `hUdom` and `hoff` with `hasCauchyPV_fdBoundary_logDeriv` — deliberately, so
that one analyticity block serves both the excised assembly and the principal value it converges
to — while each theorem also carries hypotheses the other does not.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ModularForm.intervalIntegrable_excised_deriv_smul_logDeriv_comp_ofComplex_fdBoundary`:
  the excised boundary integrand is interval-integrable on any subinterval of `[0, 5]`.

/-- **The excised boundary integrand is integrable.** Off the excision the contour stays in `U`,
where the form is analytic and nonvanishing, so its logarithmic derivative is continuous there;
with `deriv (fdBoundary H)` globally bounded, `TauCeti.Contour`'s criterion applies.

`hε` is needed to know that a point at distance `≥ ε` from every centre is not itself a centre. -/
